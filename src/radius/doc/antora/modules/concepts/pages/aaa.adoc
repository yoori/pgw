== Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting request handling

There are a lot of questions about misconfigured FreeRADIUS servers
because of misunderstanding of FreeRADIUS operations. This document
explains how the server operates.

Normally there are two steps in processing an authentication request
coming from a NAS in FreeRADIUS: authorization and authentication.
If we use FreeRADIUS as a proxy to re-send the request to another
RADIUS server there will be additional steps.

=== Authorization

Authorization is the process of finding and returning information
about what the user is allowed to do.  For example, finding out what
kind of authentication methods they are allowed to run, and what VLAN
the user should be placed into.

Authorization modules generally "get data" from somewhere,
e.g. `ldap`, `sql`, `files`, etc.

The authentication method is usually determined when the server gets
the users credentials from a database.  Once the credentials are
available, the server can authenticate the user.

=== Authentication

Authentication is simply a process of comparing userâ€™s credentials in
request with the "known good" credentials retrieved from a
database. Authentication usually deals with password
encryption. The modules `pap`, `chap`, `mschap`, etc. do authentication.

Some modules do both authentication and limited authorization. For
example, the `mschap` module authenticates MS-CHAP credentials, but it
may also be used as an authorization module, which verifies that
request contains `MS-CHAP` related attribute.  If so, the module
instructs the server to use `mschap` for authentication, too

These dual modules are usually related to protocol-specific
attributes, such as the `pap` module for the `User-Password`
attribute, `chap` for `CHAP-Password`, `mschap` for `MS-CHAP-*`, etc.

=== Request Processing

When the server processes requests, it manages four
xref:reference:unlang/list.adoc[attribute lists]:

`request`:: attributes taken from the received packet

`reply`:: attributes which will be sent in the reply

`control`:: attributes used to control how the server operates.  These are never sent in a packet

`session-state`:: attributes which are saved and restroed across multiple request / reply exchanges.

All of these lists are available to all modules.  All of these lists are available in xref:reference:unlang/index.adoc[Unlang]
