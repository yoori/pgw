   * @brief Conditional variable wrapper, which allows threads
   * to block until shared data changes state.
   *
   * A condition variable enables threads to atomically block and
   * test the condition under the protection of a mutual exclusion
   * lock (mutex) until the condition is satisfied.  That is,
   * the mutex must have been held by the thread before calling
   * wait or signal on the condition.  If the condition is false,
   * a thread blocks on a condition variable and atomically
   * releases the mutex that is waiting for the condition to
   * change.  If another thread changes the condition, it may wake
   * up waiting threads by signaling the associated condition
   * variable.  The waiting threads, upon awakening, reacquire the
   * mutex and re-evaluate the condition.
