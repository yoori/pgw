= Documentation for v4

All of the documentation, READMEs, etc. for this directory are now
stored in the `doc/raddb` directory, which is a soft link to the
Asciidoc source.  Those files are converted to HTML by Antora.

If the server is being built from source, you can build the HTML
documentation and see if via the following commands:

```
make docsite
ls build/docsite/freeradius-server/latest/index.html
```

If the server is pre-packaged, then the HTML documentation should be
available as a separate package.
